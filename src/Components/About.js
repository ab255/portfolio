        I am thirty years old and I just recently relocated to Denver, Colorado.  I was born and raised in Irvine, California where I spent almost all of my life except for the four years I went to college at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.  I ended up deciding to move to Colorado when my sister, who currently also lives in Denver, needed a new roommate and asked if I'd fill the spot.  Although I grew up next to a beach, my family has always been forrest people and I was raised to go camping and enjoy the outdoors.  It was an easy answer I ended up in an amazing outdoor area.

        I was working in retail since I graduated college, as I was an Advertising major and when I graduated in 2009 there was not a lot of jobs due to the market.  I worked my way up to store manager, but felt like I needed a career change.  I have always loved technology in general and was persuaded to look into coding.  I started by looking through online resources and decide it would be a career that would interest me.  So I started doing my research and came across Turing School of Software and Design.  I decided to put in an application and was accepted and I am now the first set of students to go through the program and I'm super excited.

        Other than my interest in all the outdoor activities in Denver, I am a huge media junkie.
        Everything thing from Movies and Television to Music and Magazines, I love it all.  It was actually the reason I studied advertising in college, because I thought it was the easiest way to apart of the scene. Now that I found coding I may not be a part of media, but I do feel I can utilize the skills I learn in advertising to create some awesome websites.
